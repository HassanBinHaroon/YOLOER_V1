# REAL_TIME_Distance-Estimation_Using_YOLOV5
YOLOER stands for You Only Look Once and Estimate Range while V1 implies the version of object detector (V1 = YOLOv5). The project is about REAL-TIME Object Detection and Distance/Depth Estimation using YOLOv5 object detector. To test the Real-Time functionality immediately, we provide the option of running the model on the webcam. Moreover, the options of testing on recorded videos and images are also provided.

Note! The project is still in progress.
